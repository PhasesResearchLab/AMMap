    "Designing an alloy is a complex procedure but for the sake of this tutorial, we will be focusing on the most common issue which is the formation of intermetallic phases which cause embrittlement and reduce the ductility of the material. **Thus, we will apply a simple constraint that the alloy should only contain the solid solution phases FCC, BCC, and HCP.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now, knowing what we are looking for (phases at equilibrium), we can start by writing a short Python script around `pycalphad` to calculate the equilibrium phases for a given chemical elements composition `elP`. It is already placed in the `examples` directory as `myPycalphadCallable.py` which defines a function `equilibrium_callable` that takes a composition and returns the equilibrium phases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**We will arbitrarily pick `1000K`** as the temperature for the sake of this tutorial, but you can change it to any other value you like. Or even make it a list and add phases present at each temperature to a set to apply our constraint over a range of temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that much more information is generated in the process (e.g., chemical composition of each phase and its fraction) but we are only interested in the phase presence. If you wish to do so, modifying the script to, e.g., allow for up to 5% of intermetallic phases, is a trivial task. Advanced users may also want to have a look at the `scheil_callable` we do not use in this tutorial for the sake of runtime, but which can be used to simulate solidification of the alloy from a liquid state in an additive manufacturing process."

In a more elaborate problem, you would likely want to implement a priority queue to explore the space in a more efficient way, but for this tutorial, this is more than enough and allows for better, more direct comparions with the typical complete exploration approach.** On the 4-core Codespaces VM you can expect it to take around 1-2 minutes. In a relatively simple problem like this one, the difference between the two approaches is not that big, coming partially from overhead of limited Python parallelization capabilities, but in a more complex problem, the difference can be dramatic."
