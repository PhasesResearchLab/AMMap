# README warning regarding deprecated files
This folder contains the files and information from previous examples/work that have since deprecated but may possibly still have value so they are not being scrubbed from the workspace. They are not maintained, they are not guaranteed to work, but they are stored here for now until deemed entirely unneeded.
